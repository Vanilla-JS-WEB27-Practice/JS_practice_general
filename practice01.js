He is known for portraits and nudes in a modern style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as Pablo Picasso and Constantin Brâncuși. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the Section d'Or group at the Salon d'Automne.",

The term \"Impressionism\" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899, he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.",

      "bio": "Kazimir Severinovich Malevich (February 23 [O.S. 11] 1879 – May 15, 1935) was a Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist, whose pioneering work and writing had a profound influence on the development of non-objective, or abstract art, in the 20th century. Born in Kiev to an ethnic Polish family, his concept of Suprematism sought to develop a form of expression that moved as far as possible from the world of natural forms (objectivity) and subject matter in order to access \"the supremacy of pure feeling\" and spirituality.Early on, Malevich worked in a variety of styles, quickly assimilating the movements of Impressionism, Symbolism and Fauvism, and after visiting Paris in 1912, Cubism. Gradually simplifying his style, he developed an approach with key works consisting of pure geometric forms and their relationships to one another, set against minimal grounds. His Black Square (1915), a black square on white, represented the most radically abstract painting known to have been created so far and drew \"an uncrossable line (…) between old art and new art\"; Suprematist Composition: White on White (1918), a barely differentiated off-white square superimposed on an off-white ground, would take his ideal of pure abstraction to its logical conclusion. In addition to his paintings, Malevich laid down his theories in writing, such as \"From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism\" (1915) and The Non-Objective World: The Manifesto of Suprematism (1926).Malevich's trajectory in many ways mirrored the tumult of the decades surrounding the October Revolution (O.S.) in 1917. In its immediate aftermath, vanguard movements such as Suprematism and Vladimir Tatlin's Constructivism were encouraged by Trotskyite factions in the government. Malevich held several prominent teaching positions and received a solo show at the Sixteenth State Exhibition in Moscow in 1919. His recognition spread to the West with solo exhibitions in Warsaw and Berlin in 1927. Upon his return, modern art was falling out of favor with the new government of Joseph Stalin. Malevich soon lost his teaching position, artworks and manuscripts were confiscated, and he was banned from making art. In 1930, he was imprisoned for two months due to suspicions raised by his trip to Poland and Germany. Forced to abandon abstraction, he painted in a representational style in the years before his death from cancer in 1935, at the age of 56.",

He was also one of the great contemporary portraitists.He was born to a modest family in 1746 in the village of Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14 under José Luzán y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.",

// Instructions:
// You are given 2 out of 3 angles in a triangle, in degrees.
// Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.
// An acute angle is less than 90 degrees.
// A right angle is exactly 90 degrees.
// An obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees (but less than 180 degrees).
// For example: missingAngle(11, 20) should return "obtuse", since the missing angle would be 149 degrees, which makes it obtuse.

// Examples:
// missingAngle(27, 59) ➞ "obtuse"
// missingAngle(135, 11) ➞ "acute"
// missingAngle(45, 45) ➞ "right"

// Notes:

//     /* something went wrong */
//      reject('oops!')
//   }, 1000)

// Notes:
// You can pass Error objects as well. Here we pass a simple string "oops!".
// Reject the promise with the simple string "It's not a dog!".
// Check the Resources tab for more info on promises.

// Title: Convert a Number to Base 2

// Instructions:
// Create a function that returns a base 2 (binary) representation of a base 10 (decimal) string number. To convert is simple: ((2) means base 2 and (10) means base 10) 010101001(2) = 1 + 8 + 32 + 128.
// Going from right to left, the value of the most right bit is 1, now from that every bit to the left will be x2 the value, value of an 8 bit binary numbers are (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).

// Examples:
// binary(1) ➞ "1"
// 1*1 = 1
// binary(5) ➞ "101"
// 1*1 + 1*4 = 5
// binary(10) ➞ "1010"
// 1*2 + 1*8 = 10

// Notes:
// Numbers will always be below 1024 (not including 1024).
// The && operator could be useful.
// The strings will always go to the length at which the most left bit's value gets bigger than the number in decimal.

// Additional notes: parseInt() is the function that does this already. Takes two arguments and returns an integer in the specified radix (second argument, basically which base you want between 2 - 36). Binary is base 2, decimal is base 10. octal is base 8, hexadecimal is base 16 (hex codes)

// Instructions:
// Create a function that transforms a string of upvote counts into an array of numbers. Each k represents a thousand.

// Examples:
// transformUpvotes("6.8k 13.5k") ➞ [6800, 13500]
// transformUpvotes("5.5k 8.9k 32") ➞ [5500, 8900, 32]

// Notes:
// Return the upvotes as an array.

// Sudo code: (first attempt)
// 1 - write a function
// 2 - pass an argument ()

// 5 - then multiple by 1000

// Sudo code: (sudo code working through it)
// 1 - write a function
// 2 - pass an argument ()
// 3 - use split to separate the string and set to a const newArr
// 4 - set s second const secondArr and .map through
// 5 - check if num.endsWith('k)
// 6 - if it's false, return the argument num turned into an integer and multiplied by 1000
// 7 - if true, set a const newNumber and .split() at 'k
// 8 - then return the const newNumber turned into a number and multiplied by 1000

// Work: 
// function transformUpvotes(str) {
//     const newArr = str.split(' ');
